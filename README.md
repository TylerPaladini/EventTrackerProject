## Event Tracker Weekend Project- Fishing Days

### Created By Tyler Paladini

### Overview
This program was created with full C.R.U.D. functionality using JPA and REST API. It was designed with the idea of being able to track fishing days for a user. The program currently has the ability to track multiple metrics that are experienced during a fishing trip to give the user relevant information on past trips. Having this information stored in a database will allow the user to research past trips and plan accordingly.

#### Lessons Learned
The main lesson learned during this project was how crucial it was to properly set up all the dependencies needed for the project. Not correctly doing that can cause serious issues that lead to needless time being spent trouble shooting.

#### Problems/Issues
During this project I ran into two main problems. First was not correctly importing the needed dependencies. That single problem caused me to lose critical time needed for the project. Instead of building the program, I wasted lots of time trouble shooting why the application would not work. The other issue I ran into was the naming of my database and database files. Not naming them with more appropriate titles and easier titles caused me to mistype and even overlooked the areas that they needed to be implemented, like the persistence.xml.

#### Future Goals
- creating a full stack web application
- creating numerous methods for the user to locate data and manipulate that data
- creating a larger database with multiple tables
